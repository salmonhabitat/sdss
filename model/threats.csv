"aThe classification is composed of 3 levels of direct threats, analogous to families, genera, and species in the Linnaean system. The first level is denoted by whole numbers and bold text (e.g., 1. Residential and commercial development). The second level is denoted by decimal numbers and roman text (e.g., 1.2 commercial and industrial areas). The third level is denoted by italic text (e.g., manufacturing plants). The classifications are designed to be comprehensive, consistent, and exclusive for the first and second levels. The third level, by contrast, currently contains only some illustrative examples rather than comprehensive listings of threats at this level.",,,,
